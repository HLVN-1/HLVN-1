### Hi, hello! 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on recreating a daily journal through HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and soon, React as well!
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on anything! But especially anything outdoors-related.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with overcoming the obstacle of not having a bachelor's degree.

I've got a background in hospitality, videography, and client management. I bartended for 4+ years where I helped lead a large team of talented individuals, competed in local and national competitions and landed my dream job in San Diego way back when! Then I ran my own wedding videography business for 3+ years where I learned a lot of time management skills, technical skills, and improved on my communication and so much more. 

My interests and hobbies are all over the place, but I especially love the outdoors, physical activities like biking, climbing, (although I don't do much of these things anymore 🥲), and dogs! I'd love to create something that would improve someone's experience in one of those things.
